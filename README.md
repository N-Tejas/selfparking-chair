# selfparking-chair
The Intelligent Parking Chair can turn 360 degrees, and finds an objective 
position with the assistance of four cameras, put all through the room, that "produce a 
best view to remotely transmit the seat's position and its course to goal." [2] It is centred
on accomplishing just a single errand (self-stopping) by coordination of sensors and 
engines controlled by microcontroller and methodology arranging/coding, in this 
manner the vehicle stage isn't worked from the parts however from changing a RC toy 
auto rather to save the time. There are three sorts of stopping designs: parallel, 
front/back-in opposite, and with a point (45 degrees normally), and this undertaking is 
generally simply centred just on parallel stopping. Making our ventures Wireless 
dependably makes it to look cool and furthermore broadens the range in which it can 
be controlled.
